## Syllabus

In designing for emergent futures, an Atlas of Weak Signals serves as a visible methodology and structure to situate students, designers and a wide range of professionals from different fields, enabling them to start identifying potential intervention opportunities. It offers immediate keywords for research and experimentation and provides a starter *design space* to gain confidence and direction on where to begin, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities.

A design space is: A navigational tool in the design practice to ground reflection. Visual databases to collect references, projects, materials, prototypes, etc.

The goal of this first Atlas of Weak Signals week is to give the students a general overview of the signals and toolkit that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hyper-local and situated view of some of the possible vectors that the Atlas presents.

=== "10/11"

    Wednesday - **Weak Signals application / Work on the Multiscalar Design Space**

    **10:00-13:00h**
    
    **Modality**: *In person, Iaac Classroom*

## Deliverables

One post on the personal student website with a reflection regarding their Atlas of weak signal design space. This reflection should include an introspective view concerning the benefits (or not) of the tool provided. High resolution image of their first Multiscalar Design Space.
