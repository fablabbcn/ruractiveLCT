## Syllabus

This course explores the use of documentation as a powerful tool to craft coherent and meaningful narratives about the design and development process. Rather than viewing documentation as mere administrative tasks or data collection, students will adopt a narrative approach to communicate their creative journey, design decisions, and project stages.

**Keywords: Documentation, Storytelling, Design Practices**

### Learning Objectives

By embracing this perspective, students will gain a deeper understanding of how design projects evolve, fostering the ability to reflect on their work and effectively convey it to others. Utilizing documentation as a narrative logbook, students will appreciate its value as an instrument that captures the creative voyage and provides a context-rich narrative for sharing with fellow designers, colleagues, and audiences interested in the design process.

1. Understand the concept of Documentation in design practice.
2. Apply narrative storytelling techniques to communicate the creative process and design decisions effectively.
3. Develop coherent and engaging narratives in the form of a design logbook.
4. Reflect on design work through documentation and narrative analysis.
