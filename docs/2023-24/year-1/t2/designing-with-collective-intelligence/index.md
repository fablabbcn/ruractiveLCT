## Syllabus

**Fair Future(s) | Designing with Collective Intelligence**

Hybrid four-day international collaborative event featuring talks, workshops, and self-organized working sessions.

In collaboration with the School of Digital Arts at Manchester Metropolitan University, this seminar offers a dynamic exploration of emerging themes and hands-on experience in the evolving landscape of creative industries and decentralized governance. It introduces concepts such as Digital Commons and Governance in Distributed Autonomous Organizations within the context of creative industries.

Participants from MDEF and SODA will form international teams to actively discuss and craft future scenarios that reflect on the upholding perma / poly crisis. During the working sessions, the teams will develop innovative, new governance and economic models. The objectives of the teams are to collectively develop a digital and/or physical artifact that will make tangible alternative modes of operation and creative expression existing within in the co-developed speculative scenarios.
The resulting projects will be presented on the online platform DAFNE+, an EU research project designed to assist digital content creators in discovering new potentials for creation, distribution, and monetization through blockchain technology.

**Keywords:Future(s), alternative governance, crafting multimedia artefacts**
