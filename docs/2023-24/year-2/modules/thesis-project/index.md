## Syllabus

**Second Year Design Studio - Master in Design for Emergent Futures**

The second year of the Design Studio in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program is dedicated to the in-depth development of students' projects, supported by complementary seminars. The structure of the second year is as follows:

**Term 1: Research and Scientific Background**

In the first term, students will focus on conducting research and establishing the scientific background of their projects. They will delve into relevant theories, methodologies, and frameworks to inform their design process. Through literature reviews, data collection, and analysis, students will gain a solid understanding of the context and theoretical foundations of their projects.

**Term 2: Community and Context Situating**

During the second term, students will shift their focus to situating their projects within a specific community and context. They will explore the social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the development and implementation of their designs. Through field research, interviews, and participatory methods, students will gain insights into the needs, aspirations, and challenges of the community they aim to serve.

**Term 3: Scalability and Business Model**

In the final term, students will work on the scalability and business model of their projects. They will explore strategies for scaling up their designs to reach a wider audience and have a greater impact. Additionally, students will develop a business model to ensure the sustainability and viability of their projects. They will consider factors such as funding, partnerships, marketing, and distribution to create a comprehensive plan for implementing their designs.

By following this structure, students in the second year of the Design Studio will have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of design for emergent futures and develop projects that address complex challenges in innovative and sustainable ways.

### Deep Explanation of Term 1: Research and Scientific Background

In the first term, students will embark on a comprehensive exploration of research and scientific background to lay a strong foundation for their design projects. The primary focus will be on conducting rigorous research and establishing a solid understanding of the context and theoretical underpinnings that inform their design process. This term will consist of various activities aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge to conduct effective research and establish a scientific basis for their projects.

### Literature Reviews

Students will engage in extensive literature reviews to identify and analyze existing research, theories, and best practices relevant to their design projects. By reviewing scholarly articles, books, and other relevant publications, students will gain insights into the current state of knowledge in their respective fields and identify gaps that their projects can address.

### Theoretical Frameworks and Methodologies

To inform their design process, students will explore and apply various theoretical frameworks and methodologies. They will critically evaluate different approaches and select the ones most suitable for their projects. By integrating theoretical frameworks into their work, students will be able to ground their designs in established principles and concepts while pushing the boundaries of innovation.

### Data Collection and Analysis

Students will learn methods and techniques for collecting and analyzing relevant data to support their design projects. This may involve conducting surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments, depending on the nature of their research. Through data collection and analysis, students will gain valuable insights and evidence to inform their design decisions.

### Contextual Understanding

In addition to conducting research, students will develop a deep understanding of the contextual factors that shape their design projects. This may include investigating social, cultural, economic, and environmental aspects that influence the problem space. By considering the broader context, students will be able to design solutions that are sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the target audience.

### Methodological Strategies

1. Research-Based Approach
2. Theoretical Frameworks and Methodologies
3. Community and Context Situating
4. Scalability and Business Model Development
5. Ethical and Sustainable Integration of Emerging Technologies

### Learning Objectives

1. Deepen understanding of technologies such as digital fabrication, AI, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, and explore their potential applications in addressing complex challenges in emergent futures.

2. Develop advanced research skills to investigate and establish the scientific background of design projects, specifically focusing on the integration of emerging technologies and their impact on societal, cultural, and environmental contexts.

3. Apply theoretical frameworks and methodologies to inform the design process and address complex challenges in emergent futures, with a particular emphasis on the ethical and sustainable integration of emerging technologies.

4. Gain an understanding of the social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence design implementation within specific communities and contexts, considering the potential implications and effects of emerging technologies on these factors.

5. Utilize field research, interviews, and participatory methods to gain insights into the needs, aspirations, and challenges of target communities in the context of emerging technologies, exploring how these technologies can be leveraged to create positive social impact.

By achieving these learning objectives, students will be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to create innovative and sustainable designs that address emergent challenges, while effectively integrating and leveraging emerging technologies in a responsible and impactful manner.
