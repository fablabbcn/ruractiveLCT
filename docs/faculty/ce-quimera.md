Artist and researcher, born in Argentina and resident in Europe since 2000, living between Barcelona and Bourges. She studied Social Anthropology in Buenos Aires, while doing internships in performing arts and in 2008, together with Kina Madno, she created the lab, Quimera Rosa. From this point on she focused her corporal and investigative work on post-identity gender policies and corporal, identity and technoscience experimentations from a trans*feminist perspective.

Her work currently focuses on the development of performances, transdisciplinary projects and interactive installations, elaborating devices that function through corporal activity and experimentations in biohacking. In 2016, she began working with Quimera Rosa on the project Trans*Plant, carried out and produced by Ars Electr√≥nica and the European Media Artists in Residence Exchange (EMARE), Hangar and the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), the University of California in Davis and L'Antre Peaux. She is a resident artist together with Gaia Leandra at the Hangar wetlab (2020/2022), where she carries out projects of investigation and experimentation in art and science from a transhackfeminist vision.
