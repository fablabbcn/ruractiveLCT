The artistic practice of Mario Santamaría (Burgos, Spain, 1985) studies the phenomenon of the contemporary observer, paying attention to two processes, the representational practices and the machines vision or mediation. Using different tactics such as appropiation, remake or assembly, his work involves different fields like the conflict, the memory, the virtuality or the surveillance. He has been a resident artist at Hangar (Barcelona, 2015), Kunststiftung Baden-Württemberg (Stuttgart, Germany, 2015) and Flax Art Studios (Belfast, Northern Ireland, 2014), among others. At CCCB he is a regular contributor to the The Influencers festival where he has developed projects such as Internet Yami-Ichi (2016, 2017) or Barcelona Internet Tour (2018).
