!!! abstract "A unique lexicon"

    Every emerging field brings forth a unique lexicon and set of definitions, underscoring the vital need for an open-contributed glossary to facilitate effective communication and collaboration within the program.

## Collaborative Glossary of Terms

`1st, 2nd and 3rd person perspective:` {.glossary-term}
    
:   There are different approaches to relate to the socio-technical system object of study. 3rd person perspective relates to gathering information without getting involved, and a 2nd person perspective is about designing with a sample of the target group. In a 1st person perspective, the designer is part of a system within the existing social structures.

:   The designer uses his or her own experience and position as part of its design research as data input. (Neustaedter, C. and Sengers, P. (2012) [Autobiographical design: what you can learn from designing for yourself. interactions 19, 6 (November + December 2012), 28–33.](https://doi.org/10.1145/2377783.2377791))
