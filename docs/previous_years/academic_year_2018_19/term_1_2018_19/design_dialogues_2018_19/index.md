## Faculty
Tomas Diez Oscar Tomico

## Assistant
Mariana Quintero


## Syllabus and Learning Objectives
Design Dialogues will expose the work of the first term by students and faculty in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. Avoiding linear discourses, the format of the sessions will be driven by conversations and debate around the areas of interest researched by the MDEF students, and their articulation with emergent future scenarios to be worked out in following terms.

The content that students present in the exhibition format should be able reflect, no matter in which medium or combination of media students choose to present it (video, prints, prototypes, story-telling, performance…):

- A clear area of interest that you chose, and how the journey has been to get there.

- The state of the art and references in your chosen field that you have researched and looked into throughout the term.

- The possible future scenarios of this area and where it finds possible areas of intervention, using speculative approaches.
