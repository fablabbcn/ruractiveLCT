## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Research Studio: Analyzing the past. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest.

**TERM 2 Design**: Design Studio: Forming the present. Building the foundations. Applying knowledge into practice. Prototyping and experimenting. Prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Development Studio: Defining the future. Establishing roadmaps. Forming partnerships. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

The Design Studio time will be dedicated to supporting students to focus their work on the development of their design intervention or project. During the studio, studio leaders will bring invited guests to introduce topics of interest to the process and to participate in tutorials during the desk crits.

## Total Duration
Weekly studio days will be every Tuesday from 11hrs to 19hrs. The program will evolve to fit the progress of the students. A general outline will be the following:
