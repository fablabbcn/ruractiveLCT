Structure of 2018-19
======================

# Fab Academy

## Faculty
 Santi Fuentemilla, Eduardo Chamorro, Xavi Domínguez, Esteban Gimenez

## Syllabus and Learning Objectives

The Fab Academy is a distributed educational model directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything. The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through an unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources.

During this 6-month programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objec


## Total Duration
Students view and participate in global lectures broadcasted every Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester.
In addition to the lectures, there are 2 / 3 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects. Each Fab Lab will establish the schedule for these Lab days.


## Structure and Phases
Apr 24: networking and communications

Apr 29 recitation: economy

May 01: mechanical design

May 08: interface and application programming

May 13 recitation: classes

May 15: machine design

May 22: wildcard week

May 27 recitation: events

May 29: invention, intellectual property, and income

Jun 05: project development

Jun 12: project presentations

Jun 14: project presentations

Jun 17: project presentations (evening)

Jun 19: project presentations

Global lectures happen on Wednesdays at 9:00 on the US East Coast (ranging from 6:00 on the West Coast to 23:00 in Japan). Recitations happen on Mondays at the same hour, and global lab sections and regional reviews are scheduled throughout the week.

## Output

Each student builds a portfolio that documents their mastery of different certificates taken individually and their integration into a final, larger project. The Fab Diploma is awarded by the Fab Academy. The Fab Diploma is earned by progress rather than the calendar, for successful completion of a series of certificate requirements. The instructional sequence requires six months to cover, although the time to finish can ranged from that up to a few years.

## Grading Method
These are reviewed by their local instructors, regional gurus, and then centrally to ensure that each student meets global standards and follows evolving best practices..

Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga (male), with Master of Architecture from the
University of la Salle Universitat Ramon LLull , Spain, as a specialist in
Architectural Design and Construction. In 2012 he graduated from the Fab
Academy Diploma at FabLab BCN, a digital fabrication and rapid prototyping
course directed by Neil Gershenfeld at MIT ́s Center For Bits and Atoms (CBA).
Currently, he is undertaking a PHD in digital fabrication processes at the EGA
UPC (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya). As a professional Santi has worked in
various architectural firms carrying out projects at the international level in the
last 10 years. He is currently the design director at OPR (Other people’s Rooms)
in Barcelona, a multidisciplinary studio based on architectural concept design for
enhanced user experiences.

Since 2013 he is part of the Fab Lab BCN team, he is the coordinator of the
Future Learning Unit (FLU), the unit focused on the design, implementation and
coordination of active learning experiences with digital manufacturing tools for
the community. FLU designs and promotes educational, innovation and
entrepreneurship projects such as AmbMakers POPUPLAB "Digital Fabrication
Everywhere", FABKIDS, CROCOPOI. FLU participates in European research
projects such as DOIT or DSISCALE and PHALABS 4.0.

Since 2014 he is Fab Instructor of the global academic program Fab Academy
and since 2017 he is professor of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures
MDEF organized by IAAC.

## Eduardo Chamorro Martin

Eduardo Chamorro is an architectural technologist, additive manufacturing expert and researcher, focusing on digital fabrication, materials, robotics and emerging technologies.

He is currently a PhD candidate at Swinburne University (Melbourne, Australia) in High performance composites additive manufacturing for architecture.

Works as faculty and researcher at FabLab Barcelona & IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, Spain as faculty in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF), Master for Advanced Architecture (MAA), Master in Advanced Ecological Buildings (MAEB), 3D Printing in Architecture (3DPA), FabAcademy at IAAC FabLab Barcelona. For him, working in a multi-scalar environment must be the priority of architects nowadays. His research focuses on the implementation of additive manufacturing technologies along different architectural scales imaging multiple processes and materialities.

Eduardo holds a Master's Degree in Architecture from CEU San Pablo University (Spain), a Fab Academy diploma in Digital Fabrication offered by the Fab Lab Network and a Master's Degree in Advanced Architecture from IAAC (Spain), with a specialisation in digital fabrication, materiality novel design methodologies. He holds as well a Spanish architectural licence.

Moreover, he has worked as Fab Lab Seoul director, researcher at several architecture studios, professor of computational design and fabrication at CEU University and advisor for various architecture collectives. He is also a regular collaborator at Fab Lab Madrid. He is always seeking innovative architecture that attempts to solve and adapt to social needs. He has also been a tutor for the Master of Science in Computational and Advanced Design (MSc CAD) at Design Morphine - UACEG (University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy).
