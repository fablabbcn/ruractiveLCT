## Syllabus and Learning Objectives
“The destiny of the world is determined less by the battles that are lost and won than by the stories it loves and believes in.“ Harold Clarke Goddard

In this studio, students will explore the impact storytelling has had and continues to have in shaping the world around us. By critically understanding how narratives have shaped the past, students will gain a practical understanding of how to shape their own communications as designers of emergent futures.

Focusing on the communications and documentation styles which will be required of students during the course, we will explore issues of representation, hermeneutics, language and semiotics in the age of hyper-personalisation and post-truth. The studio will help students to navigate the vernacular of Maker Culture and will introduce them to how and why we communicate with machines. The studio will challenge students to critically engage with the layer of intangible culture they create as designers of emergent futures; to make meaning and to situate their practice in the cultural discourse.
