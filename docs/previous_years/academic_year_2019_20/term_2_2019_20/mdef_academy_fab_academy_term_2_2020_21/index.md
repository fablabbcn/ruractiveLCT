## Syllabus and Learning Objectives

The Fab Academy is a distributed educational model directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Centre For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything. The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through an unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources.
During this 6-month programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.


## Weekly Schedule

- Students view and participate in global lectures broadcasted every Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST (3:00PM Barcelona Time). The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester.

- Students will have a local lecture every Thursday from 10:00 AM to 14:00 PM where the weekly lessons will be deeply explained.

- In addition to the lectures, there are 2 / 3 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.

- Recitations happen on Mondays at the same hour as the global class, where experts in each field will talk on each weekly topic and discuss about it.

## Output
Each student builds a portfolio on their respective websites that documents their mastery of different certificates taken individually along each week and their integration into a final, larger project, related to their masters thesis development.

The Fab Academy is earned by progress rather than a global goal, for successful completion of each assignment weekly is a must.

## Grading Method

- The student will be reviewed by turns weekly on their weekly assignmnent, on Wednesday from 3:00PM to 4:30PM.Where they will have feedback and guidance for their final master project prototype.

- Only the documentation into their webpages will be taken in account for evaluation

- The weekly standards and grading will be presented in each weekly assignment. During the master class

- Prototyping process understanding ,workflows and evolving best practices will seriously be taken in account.

## Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga

![](../../../../assets/images/faculty_photos/santi_fuentemilla_garriga.jpg)

Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga (male), with Master of Architecture from the
University of la Salle Universitat Ramon LLull , Spain, as a specialist in
Architectural Design and Construction. In 2012 he graduated from the Fab
Academy Diploma at FabLab BCN, a digital fabrication and rapid prototyping
course directed by Neil Gershenfeld at MIT ́s Center For Bits and Atoms (CBA).
Currently, he is undertaking a PHD in digital fabrication processes at the EGA
UPC (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya). As a professional Santi has worked in
various architectural firms carrying out projects at the international level in the
last 10 years. He is currently the design director at OPR (Other people’s Rooms)
in Barcelona, a multidisciplinary studio based on architectural concept design for
enhanced user experiences.

Since 2013 he is part of the Fab Lab BCN team, he is the coordinator of the
Future Learning Unit (FLU), the unit focused on the design, implementation and
coordination of active learning experiences with digital manufacturing tools for
the community. FLU designs and promotes educational, innovation and
entrepreneurship projects such as AmbMakers POPUPLAB "Digital Fabrication
Everywhere", FABKIDS, CROCOPOI. FLU participates in European research
projects such as DOIT or DSISCALE and PHALABS 4.0.

Since 2014 he is Fab Instructor of the global academic program Fab Academy
and since 2017 he is professor of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures
MDEF organized by IAAC.

## Eduardo Chamorro Martin

Eduardo Chamorro is an architectural technologist, additive manufacturing expert and researcher, focusing on digital fabrication, materials, robotics and emerging technologies.

He is currently a PhD candidate at Swinburne University (Melbourne, Australia) in High performance composites additive manufacturing for architecture.

Works as faculty and researcher at FabLab Barcelona & IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, Spain as faculty in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF), Master for Advanced Architecture (MAA), Master in Advanced Ecological Buildings (MAEB), 3D Printing in Architecture (3DPA), FabAcademy at IAAC FabLab Barcelona. For him, working in a multi-scalar environment must be the priority of architects nowadays. His research focuses on the implementation of additive manufacturing technologies along different architectural scales imaging multiple processes and materialities.

Eduardo holds a Master's Degree in Architecture from CEU San Pablo University (Spain), a Fab Academy diploma in Digital Fabrication offered by the Fab Lab Network and a Master's Degree in Advanced Architecture from IAAC (Spain), with a specialisation in digital fabrication, materiality novel design methodologies. He holds as well a Spanish architectural licence.

Moreover, he has worked as Fab Lab Seoul director, researcher at several architecture studios, professor of computational design and fabrication at CEU University and advisor for various architecture collectives. He is also a regular collaborator at Fab Lab Madrid. He is always seeking innovative architecture that attempts to solve and adapt to social needs. He has also been a tutor for the Master of Science in Computational and Advanced Design (MSc CAD) at Design Morphine - UACEG (University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy).
