Structure of 2019-20
======================

# Design Studio 3


### Intervene and create future speculations

## Track
Application

## Faculty
Tomas Diez, Oscar Tomico, Mariana Quintero   

## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analysing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time, it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the program.

## When  
**Tuesdays** from 3 to 6 pm, every two weeks

## Schedule

###  06/04 Kick off - Framing your Final Design Intervention (Alternative presents -triggering tomorrow’s tomorrow)

a. **Goals**: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a final design intervention.

b. **Activity**: Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 2nd trimester.

c.**Deliverable**: A proposal for the final intervention (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after)

d. **Task**: Start preparing and carrying out your final design intervention.


### 23/04 Measuring Impact - Strategies for Analysing your Final Design Intervention - Giovanni Macanni - Ideas For Change

a. **Goals**: Learn different strategies and methodologies of measuring impact in innovation projects, applying this knowledge to design and implement a system for your own interventions.

b. **Activity**: Understand the dimensions of your intervention that can be measured and which elements would constitute the system that would be able to give you feedback. In order to reflect on possible future iterations and to share the impact your activities have with others as part of your narrative.

c. **Deliverable**: Design a strategy to measure impact during and after your interventions.

d. **Task**: Pilot and iterate this strategy with your community, reflect on the results and the experience with its implementation.


### 04/05 Response-ability into the future - Sergio Urueña

a.**Goals**: Understand the philosophical and political foundations of care,

b. **Activity**: Analyse and map the reach of what you are able to respond to using the guidelines presented by the guest lecturer.

c. **Deliverable**: Reflect on what responsible innovation and anticipation means for your project based on what you learned in this session with Sergio. You can support this reflection with the survey he asked you to do before class and the Vision Assessment Exercise he proposed at the end of the session (Causal Layered Analysis).

d. **Task**: Activity proposed by Guest Lecturer on his suggested material.


### 18/05 Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability - Marcel van Heist

a. **Goals**: Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts.

b. **Activity**: To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions.

c. **Deliverable**: Updated version of your Design Space visualizing the socio-technical system of your project. Which elements can become part your decentralization strategy and how? Show paths of growth with new actors. Based on that create a draft roadmap for the next 5 years using a scalability matrix (columns are the years and files are the actions and actors involved).

d. **Task**: Reflect on the following questions: How much do you own of your vision? What is important to keep close to you? Who should you involve to scale up? Create a scalability matrix (a roadmap for decentralization).

### 08/06 MDEFEST Preparation

a. **Goals**: MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters’ journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long. Co-curated with faculty Daniel Charny.

b. **Activity**: Students will design a session for the fest which its main goal will be to involve the community that they have worked with & that they will like to work in the future.

c. **Deliverable**: Planning of your session.

d. **Task**: Pilot and run rehearsals of the sessions. Production, dissemination needs to be arranged at the same time.


### 14/06 - 25/06 MDEFEST

a. **Goals**: MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters’ journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long. Co-curated with faculty Daniel Charny.

b. **Activity**: Sessions will last maximum half a day, can be digital or physical (with remote streaming), done individually or in groups (preferably) and can be in the format of a workshop, a debate, a visit, a meetup or any kind of format the students find suitable for this experience.

c. **Deliverable**: Two-week time-frame to hold the sessions planned for the Fest.
