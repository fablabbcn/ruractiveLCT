## Syllabus
MDEF Research, Design, and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises, and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following:

To develop a critical position in the student’s design practice.

Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals.

Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate.

To build personal and collective repositories of resources.



## When  
**Every Monday**

## Schedule

### Monday 05/10 - 3 to 6 pm CET - 1st Person Perspective Design Interventions

**Goals**: Being resilient and resourceful as a professional. Learn about 1PP iterative design interventions methodology.

**Activity 1**: Reflect on how the new normal is shaping you personally. Explore and document a day in your life with notes, photos, videos, self-interviews…

**Deliverable 1**: One post with some visuals about my new me  (photo, video, graphics, mood board,...).

**Activity 2**: Accept and reflect on how the new normal is shaping you as a professional. Rethinking your new hyper-local and hyper-connected workspace.

**Deliverable 2**: Two posts with a new workspace including what infrastructure, people, things, and materials became available either physical or virtual in this new normal

### Monday 19/10 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Roles of Prototyping in Research through Design

**Objectives**: To learn about the different roles of prototyping in design research.

**Assignment**: From the  different roles that prototypes play in design research, reflect which ones you have used in the past and which ones you could include in your practice.

**Deliverable**: Create your own RtD toolbox. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use.

### Monday 02/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Areas of intervention in a Multiscalar Design Space

**Goals**: To learn what is a design space where you want to take your areas of interest identified in the Atlas of the Week Signals. A design space is a physical collection of experiments, reference objects, products or materials that support the development of your intervention as an action research exercise.

**Activity**: Bring your “Resource cartography in the wild”. Develop a design space integrating prototypes and projects you developed previously, your new me and workspace, the atlas of weak signals and the “resource cartography in the wild”.

**Deliverable**: A design space that is adaptable and can grow over time including the state of the art, your weak signals, resources, and personal projects. Frame your ideas in relation to your area of interest provided in the AWS. Create a design space where these relationships are visible. Your design space should contain at least: •3 objects/products that represent the issues you are enquiring in a tangible way. •3 kinds of materials that express some of the qualities of these issues. (If you had to represent your issue through materials, which would they be?). •3 reference projects or initiatives that are working around those issues (pictures, blueprints, etc) •2 reference technologies / methodologies that are being used to investigate/attend those situations •2 possible contexts in Barcelona (or not) in which you would be interested to place an intervention •2 experiments that allow you to prototype your intervention. The format of this deliverable can be physical or digital, but document it with pictures or screenshots to submit to your drive folder and share with the class.

### Monday 16/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Collaborative Documentation & Swarm Intelligence  

**Goals**: To explore and develop forms of aggregative documentation, building collective intelligence resources

**Activity**: Develop a collective framework to document explorations using the existing digital platforms, build a physical map of resources in the design studio.

**Deliverable**: Your first collaborative design intervention with the groups or communities of practice you established at the end of the Collective Wall exercise.


### Monday 30/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Framing and Making Sense of Complexity through Reflective Practices

**Objectives**: To incorporate a series of tools and methodologies to navigate through complexity in a current continuously changing reality.

**Assignment**: Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development and by means of comparing yourself and your current project to previous projects, situations you have been, and other projective techniques that will be explained in class.

**Deliverable**: Second intervention. Individually or collaboratively, building on the learnings from the first one.


### Monday 14/12 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Design Dialogues preparation

### Design Dialogues

**Objectives**: to define an area of intervention and to present the first experiments at a personal level, and in an immediate context. To produce the first group exhibition of the master’s projects.

**Deliverables**: A series of prototypes presented in a design space, a video of no more than 3 minutes (answering the question what is your fight), and a written text of 1500 words (context/area of interest, opportunities of  intervention, and state of the art).
