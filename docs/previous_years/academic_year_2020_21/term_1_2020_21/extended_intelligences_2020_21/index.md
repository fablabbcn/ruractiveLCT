## Track
Exploration

## Faculty
Lucas Lorenzo Pena, Ramon Sanguesa, Carlos Steinblock, Oliver Juggins

## Syllabus

The course explores the development of artificial intelligence and its close connection with design from its very beginning. We will delve into the concepts of design that exist in AI and will connect them with their implications and their possibilities as guidelines for emergent design. In this process, we will explore the autonomization of the object, the collective dimension of intelligent behavior, and the challenges that they pose for established design methods.

Students will complete the course having learned the following objectives:

**A brief history, state of the art of, societal relevance of:**

- Machine Intelligence

- Autonomous Systems and Agents

- Distributed Ledger Technologies

**How design, creativity, and ultimately decision making is influenced:**

- Human-Machine Interactions

- Machine-Machine Interactions

**Past present and future ethical context of:**

- Machine Intelligence

- Distributed Ledger Technology

**Practical Data Wrangling Exercises**

**Practical Experience with Machine Learning Classification and Prediction**
