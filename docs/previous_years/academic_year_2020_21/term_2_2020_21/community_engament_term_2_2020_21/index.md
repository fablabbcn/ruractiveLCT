Structure of 2020-21
======================

# Community Engagement
Navigating the dislocation and overflow of our role as designers within creative and prefigurative communities.

## Track
Exploration

## Faculty
HOLON - Markel Cormenzana, Merce Rua

## Syllabus
Design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. Evolving from a utilitarian perspective at the service of industry (design over) to the integration of the perspective of the human user and its needs (design for) and, later on,  it’s integration as an active agent in the design process (design with) the agency and expertise of the designer has been critically put into question generation after generation. Presencing the burst of the user-centered bubble and in the face of various existential risks, along with these sessions, we will inquire over our role as designers and experience what it means to design within creative communities with the goal of putting our personal projects and capacities at the service of deep transitions.

## HOLON

Holon emerges in 2014 as a proposal from the design community to what we see is humanity in transition.

From non-profit cooperatives, associations, and foundations transforming sectors such as housing or energy, to local SMEs exploring the circular economy, to programs of the United Nations working on eco-innovation or international corporations defining how sustainability fits companies of their size. We exist to help these organizations become the new normal through design. We work to align their organizational goals with the needs of the people they serve and their social and environmental context. From experiences to the ecosystem, we shape the everyday life of transitions.
