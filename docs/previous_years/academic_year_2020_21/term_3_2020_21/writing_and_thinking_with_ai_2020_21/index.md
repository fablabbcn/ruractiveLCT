# Writing and Thinking with AI

## Track
Reflection

## Faculty
 Kenric Allado-McDowell   

## Syllabus
This course will explore AI as a site for embodying and rethinking our models of the world. Using real-world examples from artistic and commercial applications of AI technology, we will seek to answer the question: how might AI change our understanding of the world and what role should designers and artists play in that transformation?

#### Key concepts to cover:

**Machine learning**

- How language models work

- Latent space

- Epistemology and bias

**Anthropology**

- Perspectivalism or multinaturalism

- Animistic worldviews and practices

- Cosmotechnics

Fundamentals of biosemiotics

Alternatives to Human-Centered Design

One-third of the class will be lectures, one-third discussion of reading, and one-third critique and discussion of student work.

## When
Mondays, from 4 to 6 pm.
