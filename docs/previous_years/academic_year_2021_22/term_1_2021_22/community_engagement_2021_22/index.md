A full week of four four-hour sessions to kickstart designing with creative communities and engaging with the social body.

## Track
 Reflection

## Faculty
HOLON - Markel Cormenzana, Merce Rua




## When  
From the 22rd to the 25th of November

## Syllabus & Schedule

Every future scenario is built by detecting “weak signals” that set trends and point to certain directions, based on the analysis of the main change factors we can detect in the present. And the present for 2022 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres.
As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities.
The goal of this first Weak Signals in the Wild Week is to give the students a general overview of the signals and toolkit that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hyper-local and situated view of some of the possible vectors that the Atlas presents.




### Tuesday 23/11 - 3:00 to 7:00 pm CET
#### Session 1: Framing - Seminar
Genealogy of our practice
Shaking the role of the designer
Experimenting with the social body
Intersecting interests, SDGs and communities
Practice or Homework: In groups. Ecosystem mapping and finding fit. Introspective work: from ego to eco meditation. We will help the students land their practice and interests in different creative communities around the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Homework to be presented on 25/11.



### Wednesday 24/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET
#### Session 2: Social Presencing Theory - Workshop - (location TBD)
During this workshop, we will embody assemblages of both human and non-human actants for sensing underlying dynamics and locating opportunities for action. We will use “planetary wellbeing” as a general framework and intentionality.

Participatory ecosystems: Knowledge as a correlate and body and bodies as epistemological instruments.

Exercise 4D Map. Visualization and direct exemplification of the generation of truth.


### Thursday 25/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET
#### Session 3: Tooling - Workshop
Reviewing task from 1st day

Mindset and ways of designing

Entering the field and ethnographic perspective *

The limits and sins of participation

Practice or Homework: Prototyping from a design within stance and social learning


### Friday 26/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET
#### Session 4: Emergent Strategy - Workshop

Theories of change. From strategic management to emergent strategy.

Intervention portfolio approach to systems transformation.

The role of experiments and non-traditional research outputs (NTRO) *

Reflecting / Sketching your role(s) in the system.

Setting an agenda and stewarding change.

Practice: speculative exercise of targeted systems change and transitions over a generation.

Along the second part of the course, the mentorship will be extended in order to facilitate groups acceding and designing within already existing communities in Barcelona.

## HOLON

Holon emerges in 2014 as a proposal from the design community to what we see is humanity in transition.

From non-profit cooperatives, associations, and foundations transforming sectors such as housing or energy, to local SMEs exploring the circular economy, to programs of the United Nations working on eco-innovation or international corporations defining how sustainability fits companies of their size. We exist to help these organizations become the new normal through design. We work to align their organizational goals with the needs of the people they serve and their social and environmental context. From experiences to the ecosystem, we shape the everyday life of transitions.
